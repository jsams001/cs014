98,HEARD.  THE MIST RISES UP THROUGH A FISSURE IN THE CEILING.  THE PATH
98,EXITS TO THE SOUTH AND WEST.
99,YOU ARE IN AN ALCOVE.  A SMALL NW PATH SEEMS TO WIDEN AFTER A SHORT
99,DISTANCE.  AN EXTREMELY TIGHT TUNNEL LEADS EAST.  IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY
99,TIGHT SQUEEZE.  AN EERIE LIGHT CAN BE SEEN AT THE OTHER END.
100,YOU'RE IN A SMALL CHAMBER LIT BY AN EERIE GREEN LIGHT.  AN EXTREMELY
100,NARROW TUNNEL EXITS TO THE WEST.  A DARK CORRIDOR LEADS NE.
101,YOU'RE IN THE DARK-ROOM.  A CORRIDOR LEADING SOUTH IS THE ONLY EXIT.
102,YOU ARE IN AN ARCHED HALL.  A CORAL PASSAGE ONCE CONTINUED UP AND EAST
102,FROM HERE, BUT IS NOW BLOCKED BY DEBRIS.  THE AIR SMELLS OF SEA WATER.
103,YOU'RE IN A LARGE ROOM CARVED OUT OF SEDIMENTARY ROCK.  THE FLOOR AND
103,WALLS ARE LITTERED WITH BITS OF SHELLS IMBEDDED IN THE STONE.  A
103,SHALLOW PASSAGE PROCEEDS DOWNWARD, AND A SOMEWHAT STEEPER ONE LEADS

106,A SIGN IN MIDAIR HERE SAYS "CAVE UNDER CONSTRUCTION BEYOND THIS POINT.
106,PROCEED AT OWN RISK.  [WITT CONSTRUCTION COMPANY]"
107,YOU ARE IN A MAZE OF TWISTY LITTLE PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
108,YOU ARE AT WITT'S END.  PASSAGES LEAD OFF IN *ALL* DIRECTIONS.
109,YOU ARE IN A NORTH/SOUTH CANYON ABOUT 25 FEET ACROSS.  THE FLOOR IS
109,COVERED BY WHITE MIST SEEPING IN FROM THE NORTH.  THE WALLS EXTEND
109,UPWARD FOR WELL OVER 100 FEET.  SUSPENDED FROM SOME UNSEEN POINT FAR
109,ABOVE YOU, AN ENORMOUS TWO-SIDED MIRROR IS HANGING PARALLEL TO AND
109,MIDWAY BETWEEN THE CANYON WALLS.  (THE MIRROR IS OBVIOUSLY PROVIDED
109,FOR THE USE OF THE DWARVES, WHO AS YOU KNOW, ARE EXTREMELY VAIN.)  A
109,SMALL WINDOW CAN BE SEEN IN EITHER WALL, SOME FIFTY FEET UP.
110,YOU'RE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A HUGE PIT, WHICH EXTENDS UP OUT OF
110,SIGHT.  A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY VISIBLE OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF
110,WHITE MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT, BECOMING THICKER TO THE LEFT.
110,MARKS IN THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT
110,SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE RECENTLY.  DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT FROM YOU AND
110,25 FEET AWAY THERE IS A SIMILAR WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM.  A
110,SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE PEERING BACK AT YOU.
111,A LARGE STALACTITE EXTENDS FROM THE ROOF AND ALMOST REACHES THE FLOOR
111,BELOW.  YOU COULD CLIMB DOWN IT, AND JUMP FROM IT TO THE FLOOR, BUT
111,HAVING DONE SO YOU WOULD BE UNABLE TO REACH IT TO CLIMB BACK UP.
112,YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTING PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
113,YOU ARE AT THE EDGE OF A LARGE UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR.  AN OPAQUE CLOUD
113,OF WHITE MIST FILLS THE ROOM AND RISES RAPIDLY UPWARD.  THE LAKE IS
113,FED BY A STREAM, WHICH TUMBLES OUT OF A HOLE IN THE WALL ABOUT 10 FEET
113,OVERHEAD AND SPLASHES NOISILY INTO THE WATER SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE
113,MIST.  THE ONLY PASSAGE GOES BACK TOWARD THE SOUTH.
114,DEAD END
115,YOU ARE AT THE NORTHEAST END OF AN IMMENSE ROOM, EVEN LARGER THAN THE
115,GIANT ROOM.  IT APPEARS TO BE A REPOSITORY FOR THE "ADVENTURE"
115,PROGRAM.  MASSIVE TORCHES FAR OVERHEAD BATHE THE ROOM WITH SMOKY
115,YELLOW LIGHT.  SCATTERED ABOUT YOU CAN BE SEEN A PILE OF BOTTLES (ALL
115,OF THEM EMPTY), A NURSERY OF YOUNG BEANSTALKS MURMURING QUIETLY, A BED
115,OF OYSTERS, A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY STARS ON THEIR ENDS, AND
115,A COLLECTION OF BRASS LANTERNS.  OFF TO ONE SIDE A GREAT MANY DWARVES
115,ARE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR, SNORING LOUDLY.  A SIGN NEARBY READS: "DO
115,NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!"  AN IMMENSE MIRROR IS HANGING AGAINST ONE
115,WALL, AND STRETCHES TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM, WHERE VARIOUS OTHER
115,SUNDRY OBJECTS CAN BE GLIMPSED DIMLY IN THE DISTANCE.
116,YOU ARE AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF THE REPOSITORY.  TO ONE SIDE IS A PIT
116,FULL OF FIERCE GREEN SNAKES.  ON THE OTHER SIDE IS A ROW OF SMALL
116,WICKER CAGES, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A LITTLE SULKING BIRD.  IN ONE
116,CORNER IS A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY MARKS ON THEIR ENDS.  A
116,LARGE NUMBER OF VELVET PILLOWS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR.  A
116,VAST MIRROR STRETCHES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST.  AT YOUR FEET IS A LARGE
116,STEEL GRATE, NEXT TO WHICH IS A SIGN WHICH READS, "TREASURE VAULT.
116,KEYS IN MAIN OFFICE."
117,YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF A LARGE, DEEP CHASM.  A HEAVY WHITE MIST RISING
117,UP FROM BELOW OBSCURES ALL VIEW OF THE FAR SIDE.  A SW PATH LEADS AWAY
117,FROM THE CHASM INTO A WINDING CORRIDOR.
118,YOU ARE IN A LONG WINDING CORRIDOR SLOPING OUT OF SIGHT IN BOTH
118,DIRECTIONS.
119,YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
120,YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
121,YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
122,YOU ARE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE CHASM.  A NE PATH LEADS AWAY FROM THE
122,CHASM ON THIS SIDE.
123,YOU'RE IN A LONG EAST/WEST CORRIDOR.  A FAINT RUMBLING NOISE CAN BE
123,HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.
124,THE PATH FORKS HERE.  THE LEFT FORK LEADS NORTHEAST.  A DULL RUMBLING
124,SEEMS TO GET LOUDER IN THAT DIRECTION.  THE RIGHT FORK LEADS SOUTHEAST
124,DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR ENTERS FROM THE WEST.
125,THE WALLS ARE QUITE WARM HERE.  FROM THE NORTH CAN BE HEARD A STEADY
125,ROAR, SO LOUD THAT THE ENTIRE CAVE SEEMS TO BE TREMBLING.  ANOTHER
125,PASSAGE LEADS SOUTH, AND A LOW CRAWL GOES EAST.
126,YOU ARE ON THE EDGE OF A BREATH-TAKING VIEW.  FAR BELOW YOU IS AN
126,ACTIVE VOLCANO, FROM WHICH GREAT GOUTS OF MOLTEN LAVA COME SURGING
126,OUT, CASCADING BACK DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS.  THE GLOWING ROCK FILLS THE
126,FARTHEST REACHES OF THE CAVERN WITH A BLOOD-RED GLARE, GIVING EVERY-
126,THING AN EERIE, MACABRE APPEARANCE.  THE AIR IS FILLED WITH FLICKERING
126,SPARKS OF ASH AND A HEAVY SMELL OF BRIMSTONE.  THE WALLS ARE HOT TO
126,THE TOUCH, AND THE THUNDERING OF THE VOLCANO DROWNS OUT ALL OTHER
126,SOUNDS.  EMBEDDED IN THE JAGGED ROOF FAR OVERHEAD ARE MYRIAD TWISTED
126,FORMATIONS COMPOSED OF PURE WHITE ALABASTER, WHICH SCATTER THE MURKY
126,LIGHT INTO SINISTER APPARITIONS UPON THE WALLS.  TO ONE SIDE IS A DEEP
126,GORGE, FILLED WITH A BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH SEEMS TO
126,HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF.  AN IMMENSE RIVER OF FIRE
126,CRASHES OUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE VOLCANO, BURNS ITS WAY THROUGH THE
126,GORGE, AND PLUMMETS INTO A BOTTOMLESS PIT FAR OFF TO YOUR LEFT.  TO
126,THE RIGHT, AN IMMENSE GEYSER OF BLISTERING STEAM ERUPTS CONTINUOUSLY
126,FROM A BARREN ISLAND IN THE CENTER OF A SULFUROUS LAKE, WHICH BUBBLES
126,OMINOUSLY.  THE FAR RIGHT WALL IS AFLAME WITH AN INCANDESCENCE OF ITS
126,OWN, WHICH LENDS AN ADDITIONAL INFERNAL SPLENDOR TO THE ALREADY
126,HELLISH SCENE.  A DARK, FORBODING PASSAGE EXITS TO THE SOUTH.
127,YOU ARE IN A SMALL CHAMBER FILLED WITH LARGE BOULDERS.  THE WALLS ARE
127,VERY WARM, CAUSING THE AIR IN THE ROOM TO BE ALMOST STIFLING FROM THE
127,HEAT.  THE ONLY EXIT IS A CRAWL HEADING WEST, THROUGH WHICH IS COMING
127,A LOW RUMBLING.
128,YOU ARE WALKING ALONG A GENTLY SLOPING NORTH/SOUTH PASSAGE LINED WITH
128,ODDLY SHAPED LIMESTONE FORMATIONS.
129,YOU ARE STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LARGE, BARREN ROOM.  A SIGN
129,POSTED ABOVE THE ENTRANCE READS: "CAUTION!  BEAR IN ROOM!"
130,YOU ARE INSIDE A BARREN ROOM.  THE CENTER OF THE ROOM IS COMPLETELY
130,EMPTY EXCEPT FOR SOME DUST.  MARKS IN THE DUST LEAD AWAY TOWARD THE
130,FAR END OF THE ROOM.  THE ONLY EXIT IS THE WAY YOU CAME IN.
