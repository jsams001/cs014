Code and file used here was for a homework problem in CS111 - Discrete 
Mathematics. The problem concerns RSA encryption: the encrypted message is 
located in the file simply named file, and the accompanying code reads each 
individual number in that file and adds it to a vector in sequential order, left
to right. Once we have the vector made, we run each individual element through 
the decryption equation, and once we get a double variable, we convert that 
double into a char to finally get Alice's original message.
